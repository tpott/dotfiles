# Empty ssh config. Each host should look like:
# Host {name}
#     HostName {domain or IP}
#     Port 22/222[2-9]
#     User {something}

# Optional parameters:
# * IdentityFile, useful for aws authentication with downloaded keys
# * ControlMaster and ControlPath, useful for caching the SSH connection
# * ForwardAgent, or else you will need to specify `-A`. Note you should call
#   `ssh-add -l` to check what keys your agent has available. You may need to
#   add `AllowAgentForwarding yes` to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the SSH server

# Misc SSH notes:
# * `ssh-keygen -R {host}` removes the host keys from ~/.ssh/known_hosts
# * `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` makes old, big RSA keys. Yuck
# * `ssh-keygen -B -f {ssh keyfile}` prints bubblebabble digest, which is
#   easier to read outloud than base64 string.
# * `ssh -L localhost:$local_port:$remote_host:$remote_port` is to view things
#   locally that are exposed on $remote_host
# * `ssh -f -N -T -R $local_port:localhost:$remote_port $username@$remote_host`
#   is an alternative to a cloudflare tunnel
#   * `-f` backgrounds the process after authentication
#   * `-N` disables remote commands
#   * `-T` disables pseudo-tty allocation
