# each line should be from `cat {~/.ssh/pub key file}`

# which is slightly more detailed than `curl https://github.com/{user}.keys`
# because it includes the {username}@{computer name}. You can check
# https://github.com/settings/keys to see the name you gave the key. It should
# match `ssh-add -l`.

# I don't know of anything that uses `ssh-keygen -B -f {~/.ssh/pub key file}`
# i.e. the bubblebabble digest, but I wish more did.
